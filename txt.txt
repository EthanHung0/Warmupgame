> horse track background wtih a question board and a timer board connected
> questions shown on board
> game master read questions it out
> teams discuss and each team gives their answer
    If correct -> press their key (1â€“4) -> perspected horse moves forward
    If wrong/no answer -> stay
> either move to the next question or skip with SPACE
> shown (answered/skipped) questions will not appear again


> 10 steps per horse to finish
> step sizes are randomized but always total the full track
> each horse has its own random distribution of steps (so not every team moves in the same "chunky" pattern)
> a team that gets 10 correct answers guarantees finishing
> finished team will not answer more questions and assigned key is disabled


> whole game = 10 minutes.
> each question: let them think for around 15 seconds before asking for skip (skip if all decided)
> if time runs out -> decide winners by who is farthest along the track

> only one winner
> when the winner is determined, stops every keypress and shows a winning banner with winner's name and an image.

> question pool: 30 prepared questions. more than enough to cover 10 steps + some skipped ones
